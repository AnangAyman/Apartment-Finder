# Apartment Finder

This project is an apartment finder that allows you to search and manipulate apartment data stored in a CSV file. It provides functionalities to filter, sort, and export the apartment data based on user queries.

## Features

- View apartment data: The program reads a CSV file containing information about apartments, including location, city, price, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, carpark availability, type (built up or not), and furnishing (fully furnished, partly furnished, unfurnished).
- Query-based filtering: Users can enter specific criteria, such as location, to filter the apartments. For example, entering "Jakarta" will display all available apartments in Jakarta.
- Customizable display: Users can specify the number of apartments they want to view. For example, entering "10" will show the top 10 results.
- Sorting functionality: The program allows sorting of apartment data based on different columns, such as price or number of rooms.
- Export data: Users can export the filtered apartment data into another CSV file for further analysis or use. This feature allows for easy data extraction and sharing.
